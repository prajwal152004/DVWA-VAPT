# üîé Vulnerability Descriptions

## SQL Injection
DVWA failed to sanitize input in GET parameters. SQLmap was able to enumerate DBs using classic boolean and time-based techniques.

## Command Injection
User input in the ping form was executed without validation, allowing attackers to run system commands like `id` and `uname`.

## Authentication Bypass
The login form logic failed to enforce strict credential checking. `' OR '1'='1` bypassed auth and gave access to the dashboard.

## FTP Brute Force
Hydra was able to crack FTP login using a common password list due to lack of rate limiting or logging.

## XSS
Reflected and stored XSS were possible via unsanitized inputs in search and comment forms.

## CSRF (Medium Level)
Although labeled "medium", DVWA used GET methods and no CSRF token or referer check, allowing a forged request to change password silently.
